# WavCreator
Creating a functional .wav file from scratch, plus a sine wave to add some sound.

## Running the output file
Personally, I find VLC to work well for this.
Installing VLC:
```bash
sudo apt-get install vlc
sudo apt-get update
```
Playing the output file:
```bash
cvlc --play-and-exit output.wav
```
